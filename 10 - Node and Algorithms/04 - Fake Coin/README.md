# Fake Coin

### This activity is a word problem that doesn't require any coding. Create a new file named `challenge-prompt.md` to write your answer.

You are opening a currency authentication business. Because you spent all your starter funds on a totally sweet market stall, you only had the money to buy a simple two-pan balance scale. The scale didn't come with any weights, but it will tell you which pan has heavier contents.

Your first customer approaches! After some discussion, you breathe a sigh of relief. His request is fulfillable despite your subpar equipment.

The customer was recently paid for his work by some less than reputable citizens. He had been given 8 visually identical coins, but he's certain one of those coins is counterfeit. According to the research you'd done before opening your stall, the current incarnation of counterfeit coins are weight slightly less than authentic coins.

What is the minimum number of times you need to use the scale in order to find which coin is counterfeit and what are the steps in order to do so.

* The number of steps is less important for the purposes of this exercise than the actions you're taking during those steps

* Once you have written your solution (or if you're stuck), refer to the hints file for the minimum number of uses. Then, if this minimum is fewer than your answer, update the steps you need to solve this problem in that number of uses.
