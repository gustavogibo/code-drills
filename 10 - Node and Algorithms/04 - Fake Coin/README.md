# Fake Coin

### This activity is a word problem that doesn't require any coding. Create a new file named `challenge-prompt.md` to write your answer.

<hr>

## You are given 8 visually identical coins and 1 two-pan balance scale. The scale doesn't come with any weights, but it will tell you which pan has heavier contents. One of the 8 coins is counterfeit and weighs slightly less than the other coins. What is the minimum number of uses of the scale necessary to find which coin is counterfeit and what the steps are in order to do so.

## The number of steps is less important for the purposes of this exercise than the actions you're taking during those steps

* Once you have written your solution (or if you're stuck), refer to the hints file for the minimum number of uses. Then, if this minimum is fewer than your answer, update the steps you need to solve this problem in that number of uses.
