### Activity 4

<br>

The minimum number of uses is 1

<br>

1. Label each stack of coins from 1 to 10.

2. Take 1 coin from stack 1, 2 coins from stack 2, 3 coins from stack 3, ..., 9 coins from stack 9, and 10 coins from stack 10

3. Put the coins you've seperated out on the scale.

4. You will be able to find out which stack the counterfeits were from by looking at how much the coins were overweight by.
    * With 55 coins on the scale, the expected weight is 550 grams if they were all authentic
    * If the stack of counterfeit coins was the first stack, the weight of the coins would be 551. If the counterfeits were the second stack, the weight of the coins would be 552. If the counterfeits were the third stack, the weight of the coins would be 553. And so on.
    * Therefor, the stack number of the the counterfeit coins is the number of grams the coins on the scale are overweight by.
    * Because each stack has a different number of coins on the scale, you can tell which stack the counterfeits came from by looking at how much the actual weight differs from the expected weight of only authentic coins.
