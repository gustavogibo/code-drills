# Mega-Modular FizzBuzz

## Refactor the solution of fizzbuzz into a (far) more modular version

 As we move through the following challenges please remember to do the following: 

1) Break Down the problem into implementable pseudocode.

- Define the input
- Define the flow of your script/method/Code
- Define the outputs
    

2) Translate that pseudocode into code.

- The pseudocode should help guide you as you code out your project

3) Once functioning refactor

- Does your code repeat itself?
- How can you DRY it up?
- Do your naming conventions adhere to the JS style guide?
- Once refactored does your code still function?


Reminder: FizzBuzz is an exercise in which you are given a list of ordered, consecutive numbers. The goal is to return `fizz` for every multiple of 3 and buzz for every multiple of 5. Naturally, you'll return fizzbuzz for numbers that can be divided by both 3 and 5. All other numbers are returned as themselves.

### Step 1
Open up prompt.html. You will find an empty fizzBuzz() function waiting for some code. Without looking at the solution, do your best to re-solve the fizzBuzz problem. 

### Step 2  

Continue on to Fizz Buzz Alpha Super. You will find a series of empty functions also waiting to have code inserted into them.
