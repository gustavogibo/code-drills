# Spiral iteration through a matrix

### A matrix is a 2 dimensional table of values. Most times, a matrix in javascript is represented as an array of arrays. For example:

```javascript
var matrix = [[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
              [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10],
              [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
              [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
```

### The above is a 5 x 4 matrix. There are many ways to iterate through this array, but for this exercise, we will be iterating through the array as a spiral spiralling inward
