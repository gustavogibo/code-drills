# Prime Factors


### In this activity, we're going to be writing a function that takes in a number and returns an array of all the factors of that number that are also prime numbers. The array should be sorted in ascending order and should not contain any repeated numbers.

For example

> primeFactors(33)

should return

> [3, 11]


For example

> primeFactors(16)

should return

> [2]
