# Sequel

### In this activity, you will be given an image of a data table and asked to create the schema for that table along with inputting the data into your sql database.

* In the provided `schema.sql` file, create a new database called "nationdata_db"

* Create a new table called "health"

* Within the table, create the schema to allow you to insert the values for the nations as defined in `data.png`.
    * Assume all the "n/a" values are 0 for the purposes of this activity 

![data](data.png)

* After you're done populating the table, use a sql query to return the highest number of doctors per 10,000 people in the table.
    * We only want the number from this query, not any other columns.

* Then use a sql query to return the lowest GDP in the table.
    * We only want the gdp from this query, not any other columns.
